    <img src="./img/day1.jpg" alt="day1" width="1250" height="800">
    Stepping into HTML felt like unlocking the core of the web. Every webpage has a structured foundation, and today, I explored how it all begins:
    
    <li>The Essential Skeleton:html, head and body form the backbone of any webpage.</li>
    
    <li>Organizing Content: Headings (h1 to h6) create a clear, readable structure.</li>
    
    <li> Making Pages Dynamic: Hyperlinks and images bring life to a blank page.</li>
    
    Understanding these fundamentals showed me that a webpage is more than just text—it's a structured blueprint ready for design and interactivity. </div>

    <img src="./img/day2.jpg" alt="" width="1250" height="800">
    Raw text alone isn’t enough—structure and readability are key. Today, I focused on organizing content effectively:
    
    <li>Enhancing Readability: Bold, italics, and underline highlighted key points.</li>
    
    <li>Layout Elements: div and span grouped content logically for easier styling.</li>
    
    <li>Semantic HTML: header, footer and section improved structure and accessibility.</li>
    
    Well-structured HTML makes webpages cleaner, more maintainable, and enhances usability for a better user experience.</div>

    <img src="./img/day3.jpg" alt="" width="1250" height="800">
    Websites aren’t just static—they organize and collect data. Today, I explored how HTML lays the foundation for this:
    
    <li>Lists: Improve readability and navigation.</li>
    
    <li>Tables: Structure complex data with table, th, tr, and td.</li>
    
   <li> Forms: Enable user interaction with input fields, checkboxes, and buttons.</li>
    
    Seeing how webpages gather and structure information was a game-changer—HTML is the first step toward building interactive experiences.</div>

        <img src="./img/day4.jpg" alt="" width="1250" height="800">

        Today was all about transforming plain HTML into a visually appealing webpage using CSS.
        
        <li>Understanding Selectors: Learned how to target elements using class, ID, and tag selectors.</li>
        
        <li>Playing with Colors & Fonts: Explored how color, background-color, and font-family enhance design.</li>
        
        <li>The Power of Spacing: Used margin and padding to control layout and create a balanced structure.</li>
        
        Seeing how simple CSS properties can completely change the look and feel of a page was eye-opening. It’s not just about structure anymore—it’s about style and user experience!</div>




    <div id="c2">Day 5: Mastering Layout and Styling in CSS
        <img src="./img/day 5.jpg" alt="" width="1250" height="800">

        Today, we took a deeper dive into CSS, focusing on background colors, layout structuring, and flexible design techniques.
        
        <li>Background & Aesthetics: Experimented with background-color to add depth and contrast.</li>
        
        <li>Structuring with div: Used div as a container to group elements and improve organization.</li>
        
        <li>Box Model Mastery: Explored how margin, padding, border, and width control spacing and element positioning.</li>
        
        <li>Introducing Flexbox: Learned how display: flex helps align and distribute elements efficiently, making layouts more responsive.</li>
        
        Seeing how CSS shapes structure and enhances design reinforced the importance of both aesthetics and functionality in web development!</div>
